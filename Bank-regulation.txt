Components {

  Bank regulation is a complex process and generally consists of two components:
    - licensing (sets certain requirements for starting a new bank., and
    - supervision ( an extension of the licence-granting process and consists of supervision of the bank's activities by a government regulatory body)

{ Instruments and requirements

  { Capital requirements

    The capital requirement sets a framework on how banks must handle their
       capital
    in relation to their
      assets. 

  }
  { Reserve requirements

    The reserve requirement sets the minimum reserves each bank must hold to demand deposits and banknotes. 

    This type of regulation has lost the role it once had, as the emphasis has
    moved toward capital adequacy, and in many countries there is no minimum
    reserve ratio.

  { Corporate govenance

    Corporate governance requirements are intended to encourage the bank to be
    well managed, and is an indirect way of achieving other objectives

  }
  { Financial reporting and disclosure requirements

    Among the most important regulations that are placed on banking institutions is the requirement for disclosure of the bank's finances.

    In the US for example the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires
    management to prepare annual financial statements according to a financial
    reporting standard, 

    The Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002 outlines in detail the exact structure of the reports that the SEC requires.

  { Credit rating requirement

    Banks may be required to obtain and maintain a current credit rating from an approved credit rating agency, and to disclose it to investors and prospective investors. 
    
  }
  { Large exposures restrictions

    Banks may be restricted from having imprudently large exposures to individual counterparties or groups of connected counterparties
