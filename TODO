Risk measures

   Risk measurese are a major component in modern portfolio theory (MPT)

   Five risk measures
   -
   Used in MPT (modern portfolio theory)
    - alpha (risk relative to market or benchmark index, »risk-adjusted return«). Alpha is a measure of performance (»active return«). α > 0 -> better performance, α<0 -> worse performace
      gauges the performance of an investment against a market index or benchmark which is considered to represent the market’s movement as a whole. 
      The excess return of an investment relative to the return of a benchmark index is the investment’s alpha.
      Aka:
        - Excess return
        - Abnormal rate of return
    - beta (measures volatility or systemic risk in comparison to market or benchmark index) β=1 -> fund moves equal to market, β<1 -> fund is less volatile. β=0: no correlation, β<0: contrary to benchmark
    - R-Squared: How much of movement can be attributed to movements in benchmark index
    - Standard deviation: the lower the standard deviation, the lower the volatility.
    - Sharpe ratio: Average return earned in excess of the risk-free rate per unit of volatility or total risk. 

  Unsystematic risk:
    Aka: “nonsystematic risk,” "specific risk," "diversifiable risk" or "residual risk" 

    Unsystematic risk is unique to a specific company or industry. 
    the uncertainty inherent in a company or industry investment

    Types of unsystematic risk include
      - a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take significant market share from the company invested in;
      - a regulatory change, which could drive down company sales;
      - a shift in management;
      - and/or a product recall.

    unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification.


Benchmark:
   a standard against which the performance of a security, mutual fund or investment manager can be measured. 

Securities
  - stocks
  - bonds
  - money market
  - other asset

Trading strategy is a fixed plan that is designed to achieve a profitable
  return by going long or short in markets. The main reasons that a properly
  researched trading strategy helps are its verifiability, quantifiability,
  consistency, and objectivity.
Trading strategies are based on fundamental or technical analysis, or both. T

Asset
  a resource with an economic value


Dispersion is a statistical term describing the size of the range of values expected for a particular variable. 

Standard deviation
  a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean.

  Standard deviation is simply the square root of the variance.

  If the data behaves in a normal curve, then 68% of the data points will fall within one standard deviation of the average, or mean data point. 
  
  In finance:
    when applied to the annual rate of return of an investment, it sheds light on the historical volatility of that investment.
    The greater the standard deviation, the greater the volatility.

Portfolio

  A grouping of financial assets (stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies and cash equivalents as well as their fund counterparts including mutual, exchange-traded and closed funds)

  - Modern portfolio theory

  Allocation strategies
    - 60/40 
    - Risk parity

  Portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best portfolio (asset distribution), out the set of all portfolios being considered, according to some objective. 

mutual funds

  - is an investement vehicle
  - Pool of money
  - generally don't enter into short positions as one of their primary goals
  - shareholders participate proportionally in gains/losses of fund
  - Often part of a larger investement company apparatus

  NAV
    NAV = total value of securities in porfolio / total amount of shares outstanding
    NAVPS = NAV ps share

  Purpose:
    - Invest in securities
    - Produce capital gains and income for fund's investors.

  Types:

  Managed by professional money managers
    - fund manager is hired by *board of directors*

  Portfolios:
    - structured
    - maintained to match the INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES* statet in the PROSPECTUS

Algorithmic Trading
  Aka algo trading, black box trading

  - uses advanced and complex mathematical models and formulas
  - makes high speed decisions for transactions in financial markets
  - involves fast computer programs to determine trading strategies for optimal returns



Black-Sholes Model
  Aka Black-Scholes-Merton model

  The Black Scholes Model is one of the most important concepts in modern financial theory. 

  It provided a solution for a practical problem, that of finding a fair price
  for a European call option, i.e., the right to buy one share of a given stock
  at a specified price and time. Such options are frequently purchased by
  investors as a risk-hedging device.

  developed in 1973 by Fisher Black, Robert Merton and Myron Scholes.
  Still widely used.

  only used to price European options and does not take into account that American options could be exercised before the expiration date

  Assumptions

   - The model assumes stock prices follow a lognormal distribution because asset prices cannot be negative.
   - no transaction costs or taxes;
   - the risk-free interest rate is constant for all maturities (Might not be true in reality)
   - short selling of securities with use of proceeds is permitted;
   - and there are no riskless arbitrage opportunities.
   - volatility remains constant over the option's life (Not the case in real life - volatility fluctuates with level of supply and demand)

  The Black Scholes model requires five input variables
    - the strike price of an option,
    - the current stock price,
    - the time to expiration,
    - the risk-free rate and
    - the volatility. 

  Formula
    Multiply the stock price by the cumulative standard normal probability distribution function. 

  a model of price variation over time of financial instruments such as stocks that can, among other things, be used to determine the price of a European call option. T

  The model assumes the price of heavily traded assets follows a geometric Brownian motion with constant drift and volatility.

  When applied to a stock option, the model incorporates the constant price variation of the stock, the model incorporates the constant price variation of the stock, the time value of money, the option's strike price and the time to the option's expiry. 
  

Modern portfolio theory (MPT)

  MPT makes the assumption that investors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. 

  Modern portfolio theory, fathered by Harry Markowitz[1][2] in the 1950s,
  assumes that an investor wants to maximize a portfolio's expected return
  contingent on any given amount of risk, with risk measured by the standard
  deviation of the portfolio's rate of return, or by statistical dispersion.

  Modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a theory on how risk-averse investors can
  construct portfolios to optimize or maximize expected return based on a given
  level of market risk, emphasizing that risk is an inherent part of higher
  reward. 


  MPT is a standard financial and academic methodology for assessing the performance of a stock or a stock fund as compared to its benchmark index.

  MPT shows that an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will maximize returns for a given level of risk. 

  Risk and expected retuern
     - Expected return: weighted sum
     - Risk: complicated function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets.
  Because of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or standard deviation, is lower than what would be calculated by a weighted sum.

  Efficient frontier

    Every possible combination of assets that exists can be plotted on a graph,
    with the portfolio's risk on the X-axis and the expected return on the
    Y-axis. 

    It is possible to draw an upward sloping hyperbola to connect all of the
    most efficient portfolios, and this is known as the efficient frontier.
    Investing in any portfolio not on this curve is not desirable.

    According to the theory, it's possible to construct an "efficient frontier"
    of optimal portfolios offering the maximum possible expected return for a
    given level of risk. 

    This theory was pioneered by Harry Markowitz in his paper "Portfolio
    Selection," published in 1952 by the Journal of Finance.

Quantitative trading.


  first: quantiative analysis (number crunching) -> formulate strategy

  Works well in bull market.

  Developers and/or analyts are called *quants* or *quant jockeys*.

  Only as good as the model developed!

  Historically, these team members worked in the back offices, but as quant models became more commonplace, the back office is moving to the front office.


  Techniques
     - Monte Carlo methods and
     - finite difference methods, 

  Emanuel Derman's 2004 book My Life as a Quant helped to both make the role of
  a quantitative analyst better known outside of finance, and to popularize the
  abbreviation "quant" for a quantitative analyst.[7]

  Characteristics
    - reliance on algorithmic or systematically programmed investment strategies.
    - Higher management fees

  Advantages
    - Lower cost basis (because of less analysts and portfolio managers)

  Disadvantages
    - »Black box« is not really liked


  Strategy:
    - Start with universe or benchmark
  
  Possible because of modern technologies:
    - mathematics
    - availability of comprehensive databases
    - Big data
    - using computers to automate the monitoring, analyzing, and trading decisions.

  Steps:
    - Create mathematical and statisical model (to parse vast data sets of trading signals)
    - Develop computer program that applies model to (historic market) data -> exploit predictive patterns
    - backtest model (Note: actual applications and success rate are debatable.)
    - optimize
    - As soon as favorable results are achieved, system is implemented in realtime markets with real capital.

  Goal:
    - Base strategy on discpiline
    - making rational trading decisions: Computers, not emotionally flawed humans, make decision
    - calculate the optimal probability of executing a profitable trade

  Challanges:
    - Overcoming emotions such as fear or greed which stile rational thinking

  Quant trading is a dispassionate decision making process. 

  Quants focus entirely on numbers and patterns (data) and use mathematics.
    (Seeking to identify patterns)
    - Main input for data for mathematical models:
       - Price
       - Volume

     Skills of quant developers:
        C, C++, Java, R, MATLAB, Mathematica, Python.
        GNU Octave

        Quantitative developers are computer specialists that assist, implement and maintain the quantitative models. 

         bridge the gap between software developer and quantitative analysts.

     Typical problems
       A typical problem for a MATHEMATICALLY ORIENTED QUANTITATIVE analyst would be to develop a model for pricing, hedging, and risk-managing a complex derivative produc

       A typical problem for a STATISTICALLY ORIENTED QUANTITATIVE analyst would be to develop a model for deciding which stocks are relatively expensive and which stocks are relatively cheap. T

    Types
      - LQ
      - ATQ (higly paid)
      - 

    Tasks:
      - determine prices,
      - manage risk,
      - and identify profitable opportunities.

  Process:
    - Culling through vast amounts of data

  Techniques:
    - High frequence trading (HFT)
    - Algorithmic trading
    - Statistical arbitrage
    - moving averages
    - oscillators
  
  Risk control

  Quantitative trading generally used by financial institutions and hedge funds.
  
  Patterns might change on inflection points

  Combine quantitative strategy with QUALITATIVE strategy.

  It is also a cost-effective strategy. Since computers do the work, firms that rely on quant strategies do not need to hire large, expensive teams of analysts and portfolio managers.

  Financial modeling
    - is the task of building an abstract representation (a model) of a real world financial situation.
    - In quantitative finance, financial modeling entails the development of a sophisticated mathematical model.
    - Models here deal with
      - asset prices,
      - market movements,
      - portfolio returns and the like. 

    These problems are generally stochastic and continuous in nature, and
    models here thus require 
      - complex algorithms,
      - entailing computer simulation,
      - advanced numerical methods (such as
          - numerical differential equations,
          - numerical linear algebra,
          - dynamic programming) and/or
          - the development of optimization models

  History
      Quantitative finance started in 1900 with Louis Bachelier's doctoral thesis *Theory of Speculation*, which provided a model to price options under a 
        *Normal Distribution*
    
      Harry Markowitz is generally credited with beginning the quantitative
      investment movement when he published a “Portfolio Selection” in the Journal
      of Finance in March of 1952. 
      Markowitz used math to quantify diversification, and is cited as an early
      adopter of the concept that mathematical models could be applied to
      investing.

      Markowitz formalized a notion of mean return and covariances for common
      stocks which allowed him to quantify the concept of "diversification" in
      a market

      He showed how to compute the mean return and variance for a given
      portfolio and argued that investors should hold only those portfolios
      whose variance is minimal among all portfolios with a given mean return. 

      In 1965 Paul Samuelson introduced *stochastic calculus* into the study of finance.

      In 1969 Robert Merton, another pioneer in modern financial theory, promoted continuous stochastic calculus and continuous-time processes. 


  Merton + Markowitz: Foundation for quantitiative (quant) approach to investing

  Unlike traditional qualitative investment analysts,
    quants don’t visit companies,
    meet the management teams or
    research the products the firms sell
  in an effort to identify a competitive edge.

Securitization is the financial practice of pooling various types of
  contractual debt such as residential mortgages, commercial mortgages, auto
  loans or credit card debt obligations (or other non-debt assets which generate
  receivables) and selling their related cash flows to third party investors as
  securities, which may be described as bonds, pass-through securities, or
  collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Investors are repaid from the principal
  and interest cash flows collected from the underlying debt and redistributed
  through the capital structure of the new financing. Securities backed by
  mortgage receivables are called mortgage-backed securities (MBS), while those
  backed by other types of receivables are asset-backed securities (ABS).
-
Securitization is the method utilized by participants of structured finance to create the pools of assets that are used in the creation of the end product financial instruments.
-
Structured finance is a sector of finance that was created to help transfer risk
  using complex legal and corporate entities. This transfer of risk, as applied
  to the securitization of various financial assets (mortgages, credit card
  receivables, auto loans, etc.), has helped provide increased liquidity or
  funding sources to markets like housing and to transfer risk to buyers of
  structured products;
